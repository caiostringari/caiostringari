I am an Earth Scientist (PhD, University of Newcastle, Australia) with a background in  physical oceanography (B.Sc., Federal University of Rio Grande, Brazil). I am specialized in using machine learning and data-driven techniques to solve challenging environmental problems. My work so far focused mainly to study water waves processes such as wave breaking, energy dissipation, and wave-wave interactions - which have several coastal and ocean engineering applications. I program mostly in `python` but can work proficiently with `Fortran`, `Matlab` and (occasionally) `C++`.
